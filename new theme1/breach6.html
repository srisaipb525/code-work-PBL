            <b>Have I Been Pwned</b> secure password checking service.

        <h2 class="section-title">🔍 Why It Matters</h2>
        <p class="text-block">
            🛑 Your password may already be leaked without your knowledge from past cyber-attacks.<br>
            🧠 Attackers reuse stolen passwords to access email, banking, and social media accounts.<br>
            📡 HIBP checks whether your password has appeared in known data breaches across the world.<br>
            🔐 It uses secure k-anonymity hashing, so your password is not shared directly.<br>
            ⚠️ If compromised, it advises you to change it immediately & enable 2FA.<br>
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">🤔 Why It’s Important?</h2>
        <p class="text-block">
        🛡️ Early detection of password breaches helps prevent identity theft and financial fraud.<br>

        🔓 If your password appears in leaked databases, it means attackers may already have access to one of your accounts.<br>

        ⚙️ Knowing this early allows you to immediately change the password and enable 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) to secure your account.<br>

        🔁 Even if one account is hacked, attackers often attempt the same password across other platforms (known as Credential Stuffing attacks).<br>

        💡 It promotes safe digital practice by encouraging users to avoid password reuse and use stronger authentication methods.<br>

        <h2 class="section-title">💡 How to Use</h2>
        <p class="text-block">
            🔑 1. Open the link: https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords <br>
            🖊️ 2. Type a password you want to test (not your main password).  <br>
            🔍 3. Click on the “Check Password” button.  <br>
            📊 4. The system will compare it against leaked password databases.  <br>
            ⚠️ 5. If the result shows "Pwned", change your password immediately.  <br>
            🔐 6. Always enable 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) on important accounts.  <br>
